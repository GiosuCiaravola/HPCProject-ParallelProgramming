*   Exercise 1 - Map Reduce
*
*   Develop a program using Hadoop Map Reduce to analyze the available dataset differently from the second exercise
*   (e.g., a statistic, a ranking, an index, etc.). 
*
*   For this task, the decision has been made to calculate the ranking of players who have scored the most goals overall. 
*   The number of players considered for the ranking is taken from the command line. 
*   Additionally, for each player, all the goals scored are listed, as an inverted index, indicating in which match they were made.
