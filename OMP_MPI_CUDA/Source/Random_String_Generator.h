/**
 * @brief Generates a random string of specified length using the given seed.
 *
 * @param n_characters The desired length of the generated string.
 * @param seed         The seed value for the random number generator.
 * 
 * @return             A dynamically allocated char array (string) containing
 *                     random characters. It is the responsibility of the caller
 *                     to free the allocated memory using free() when done using
 *                     the generated string.
 *                     Returns NULL in case of memory allocation failure.
